Tetrarcana is a local 1v1 turn based game where players fight to turn an empty grid into their colour by combining and placing Tetris pieces on a board. The game ends when 90% of the board has been filled with both players colours. The player who has coloured most of the board wins!

Controls:
Move the mouse to choose where to place blocks. Press "E" to rotate.

Place tiles on the smaller combining board before you place them in the larger battle board.

Tetrarcana was built in two weeks as a first project by a small dev team for PirateSoftware's game jam.
